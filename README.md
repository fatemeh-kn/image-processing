## Iron-Deficiency Anemia

**Anmia's key facts based-on WHO report (<a href="ttps://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anaemia)">1 May 2023</a>)**

* Anemia is major public health concern, mainly affecting young children, pregnant and postpartum women, and menstruating adolescent girls and women.
* Low- and lower-middle income countries bear the greatest burden of anaemia, particularly affecting populations living in rural settings, in poorer households and who have received no formal education.
* Globally, it is estimated that 40% of all children aged 6–59 months, 37% of pregnant women and 30% of women 15–49 years of age are affected by anaemia.
* Anaemia caused 50 million years of healthy life lost due to disability in 2019. The largest causes were dietary iron deficiency, thalassaemia and sickle cell trait, and malaria (1).
